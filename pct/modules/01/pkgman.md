## Python environment

Python is a popular programming language widely used for scientific computing.
It is known for its simplicity and readability. Python has a rich ecosystem of
libraries and tools that make it a powerful language for data analysis, machine
learning, and web development.

One of the most important aspects of software development is the management of
dependencies. Python provides a package manager called `pip` that makes it easy
to install and manage dependencies.
